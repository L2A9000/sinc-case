Sinc Keyboard Case
==================

Here's case design file for the [Sinc](https://keeb.io/products/sinc-split-staggered-75-keyboard). The .ai files have multiple layers to toggle on/off to generate the correct set of plates/mid-layers/etc.

3D Printed Middle Layers
------------------------

These are the STL files in the repository. These are an initial version of the design, as a more complete design with tighter cutouts for USB-C and TRRS ports will be made.

### New Enclosed Design

In the [enclosed-case](enclosed-case/) folder, there are STL files for a new design where the FR4 switch and bottom plates are used but have their sides covered. The top shell has been designed to be threaded into directly from underneath using [M2 screws that are 16mm](https://keeb.io/products/m2-screws-and-standoffs?variant=39401487040606) in length.

At the moment, the mid layer files are only for Rev. 2, but Rev. 1 files will be made to handle the TRRS jacks. The top shell files are compatible with both Rev. 1 and 2.
